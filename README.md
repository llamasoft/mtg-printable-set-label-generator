Magic: the Gathering Printable Set Label Generator
==================================================

This is a script for generating Magic: the Gathering (MTG) printable set labels
in order to organize a collection of cards.
The code is powered by the [Scryfall API](https://scryfall.com/docs/api/sets).
As soon as a new set is up on Scryfall,
the label for that set can be generated and printed.

- Print on Avery Address Labels

  - for laser printer [Avery 5160](https://www.amazon.com/Avery-Address-Labels-Laser-Printers/dp/B00006B8FZ)
- Attach set labels to [BCW Tall Trading Card Dividers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00S3FF1PI)

## Usage

If you're just interested in downloading and printing these set labels,
check out the [web frontend](https://mtg-printable-label.fly.dev/)
([code](https://github.com/gofrolist/mtg-printable-set-label-frontend))
and generate your own labels.


### Advanced

If you want to further customize things, read on!

The script `generator.py` is a Python script to generate the printable labels.
It requires Python 3.6+ and has a few dependencies.

    brew install cairo                # Install vector graphics library
    pip install poetry                # Install python dependency management tool
    poetry install                    # Install python dependencies
    pip install --editable .
    python mtglabels/generator.py     # Creates SVG & PDF files in output/

By default, this will create SVG & PDF files.
The SVG files are vector image files that can be customized further.
The PDF files are ready to print.

The SVGs use the free fonts [EB Garamond](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/EB+Garamond) bold and [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro) regular.


### Customizing

A lot of features can be customized by changing constants at the top of `generator.py`.
For example, sets can be excluded one-by-one or in groups by type or sets can be renamed.

The labels are designed for US Letter paper but this can be customized:

    # Show all options
    python mtglabels/generator.py --help
    
    # Use A4 paper size
    python mtglabels/generator.py --page-width=210 --page-height=297
    
    # Use smaller 1" x 0.375" labels (sizes in mm)
    python mtglabels/generator.py \
        --columns 7 --rows 22 \
        --label-width 25 --label-height 9.5 \
        --margin-width 11.5 --margin-height 4

The label layouts can be customized:

    # List available layouts
    python mtglabels/generator.py --template
    
    # Use different label layout
    python mtglabels/generator.py --template icon_only.svg.jinja

You can generate labels for specific sets as well:

    # Specific list of set codes
    python mtglabels/generator.py lea mh1 mh2 neo
    
    # Python expression to filter sets
    python mtglabels/generator.py --set-filter 's["set_type"] in ("core", "expansion")'


You can change how the labels are actually displayed and rendered by customizing `templates/labels.svg`.
If you change the fonts, you may also need to resize things to fit.


### Tips for printing SVGs

If you're just using the default PDFs, you probably won't need this.
However, if you are customizing the SVGs and printing them, this section is for you.

The output SVGs are precisely sized for a sheet of paper (US Letter by default).
Make sure while printing in your browser or otherwise to set the margins to None.

You can also "print" to a PDF.
